# DeLancer

Freelancing platform based on concept of blockchain smart contracts.

## Description

Many problems happen during the completion of a freelancing project. The employer does not want
to deposit the whole payment before getting the final project and the freelancer also does not want
to start working on the project without getting security about the payment. The freelancer does not
even know the actual financial position of the employer.
Many questions come across every freelancer about the employer: Does he have enough money for
the payment of the project? What if he doesn't pay after the completion of the project?
Now the real question is, Is it possible the given scenario that involves the employer and freelancer
can be carried out frictionlessly and both the entity can trust on the state of the contract?
Yes, It's entirely possible to achieve the above scenario with a smart contract. Solidity smart
contracts are immutable, public and the participant can not avoid any rules or restrictions which are
defined inside it. We can use this advantage so that the freelancer will get the money after the
completion of every module and the final project submission.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Node and MongoDB for backend.
* React for frontend.
* Solidity for Smart contracts.

### Installing

* Clone the repository
* Run ```npm install``` At the root of cloned directory.
* Go to ```backend``` folder and again run `npm install`.
* Above two commands will install libraries and frameworks for the platform.

### Executing program

* Open two terminals one for running frontend develpoment server at the root of the project.
* Open second terminal at ```./backend``` for running backend server.
* Run ```npm start``` to start both the servers.
